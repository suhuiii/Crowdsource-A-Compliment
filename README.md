## How it works
This app randomly pick a word (e.g. "resourceful") from a list of positive adjectives. 
It then searches twitter for tweets containing the word.

The program then replaces all text before the word with "You are" or "{Name} is".

The resulting string wil be spoken out loud by Alexa, and also put onto an Alexa card.

## Example Compliments
> Your compliment about Ryan is..
> Ryan is generous to you, but hey, as long as there is wine and a big screen
